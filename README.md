### discrelay_discordbottoken

### discrelay_discordserverid

### discrelay_msg_textcol & discrelay_msg_varcol

								g_msg_varcol, discorduser, g_msg_textcol,
								g_msg_varcol, discriminator, g_msg_textcol,
								message)
discorduser, discriminator, and message are discord things, but g_msg_textcol and g_msg_varcol refer to the colors used for the message that will be sent to the server when doing discord -> server. The plugin uses morecolors.inc to supply the colors, so when setting the cvar make sure to set it like {red} for example. Depending on the game you are using different options to set the color can be chosen such as using hex (more information here https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=247770).
